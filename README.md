## Current Projects

- **Shiloh Academie, Gandigal-Est, Senegal**: Development and maintenance of a custom website to enhance local educational outreach and resource distribution.
- **E.V.A École, Dakar, Senegal**: Exploring collaboration opportunities to set up a digital platform that meets the specific needs of the local school community.

## How We Work

Our process is built on open communication and tailored solutions. We collaborate closely with local school administrations to ensure that each project is aligned with their specific needs and aspirations. Each website is developed based on direct feedback from the schools, ensuring that they serve as effective educational tools.
